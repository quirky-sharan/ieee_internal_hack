"""
ClinicalMind — Dynamic Differential Diagnosis Interview Engine (V4)
Generates unique, non-repeating, clinically relevant follow-up questions.

ANTI-REPETITION GUARANTEES:
1. Every generated question string is tracked in session state and NEVER reused.
2. Every symptom ICD code that has been asked about is tracked and excluded.
3. Fallback questions use a fixed ordered pool, not random.choice.
4. The function accepts the FULL history of asked questions and codes.
